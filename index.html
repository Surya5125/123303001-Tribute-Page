            <h3>Here's a timeline of Dr. Srinivasa Ramanujan's life:</h3>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1887</span> - Born in Erode, Mysore, India</li>
                    <li><span>1889</span> - Moved to Kanchipuram, Chennai due to smallpox outbreak.</li>
                    <li><span>1892</span> - He was enrolled in a local school, with a local constable enlisted by his family to ensure his attendance.</li>
                    <li><span>1897</span> - passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.</li>
                    <li><span>1904</span> - He independently explored and developed the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant to 15 decimal places. He graduated from Town Higher Secondary School and was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school’s headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer.</li>
                    <li><span>1906</span> - Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Lacking an FA degree, he left college and continued his independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation..</li>
                    <li><span>1910</span> - After a meeting with V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, the 23-year-old Ramanujan began to gain recognition in Madras’s mathematical circles, which led to his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras..</li>
                    <li><span>1911</span> - In his 17-page paper “Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers”, Ramanujan presented three proofs, two corollaries, and three conjectures.</li>
                    <li><span>1913</span> - He received a letter from Hardy expressing interest in his work, stating that it was “essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions”. He declined to leave his country to “go to a foreign land”."</li>
                    <li><span>1916</span> - He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts by Research degree (the predecessor of the PhD degree) for his work on highly composite numbers, sections of the first part of which had been published the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. The paper was more than 50 pages long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy disliked this topic area but noted that though it engaged with what he called the ‘backwater of mathematics’, in it Ramanujan displayed ‘extraordinary mastery over the algebra of inequalities’.</li>
                    <li><span>1917</span> - was elected to the London Mathematical Society.</li>
                    <li><span>1918</span> - He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, becoming the second Indian admitted, after Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841. At age 31, Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the Royal Society’s history. He was elected “for his investigation in elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers.” On 13 October 1918, he became the first Indian to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</li>
                    <li><span>1919</span> - was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin deficiency, and confined to a sanatorium. He returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency</li>
                    <li><span>1920</span> -  At the age of 32, Ramanujan passed away. Post his death, his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan’s remaining handwritten notes, which included formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series, and continued fractions.</li>
